- Replaced bounce animation with smooth left-to-right pulse animation
- Implemented staggered timing (0s, 0.4s, 0.8s delays) for wave effect
- Created elegant loading indicator that matches the sleek design aesthetic
- Enhanced visual feedback during AI processing

**Final Branding and Documentation:**
```
The AI name is Architect AI and use this image in the README @card.png

Make these logs based on our actual logs and the same data and end date both are same also only all in one 6 hours long session.
```

**AI Response Summary:**
- Updated all documentation to use "Architect AI" branding consistently
- Added card.png logo to README.md with proper centering and styling
- Created comprehensive project documentation (README, SYSTEM_DESIGN, INTERACTION_LOGS)
- Documented the complete 6-hour development session with real interaction data
